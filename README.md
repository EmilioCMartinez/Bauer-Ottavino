# Bauer-Ottavino
ECDF plots of Trevor Bauer and Adam Ottavino, by pitch, for 2019 season

Code to generate ECDF plots for Trevor Bauer and Adam Ottavino, 2019 season. Code is not in sequencial order but spaced off to create multiple plots

Using some ECDF plots to compare two players with great breaking balls in 2019, Trevor Bauer & Adam Ottavino. Ottavino has more extension and higher vert release height with his FT compared to SL, but releases his SL from a more horizontal slot than his FT. Bauer is almost identical except seems to have a lower vert release on his FT compared to SL and >= extension than his FF. But looking @ horizontal release point, his FT is much more than his FF & closer to his slider, seemingly in order to get his horizontal movement.
